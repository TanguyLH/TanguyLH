## My recommendations

I really enjoy some tech contents on internet, and here are a few that translated very well into programming skills in my book
- [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/) - a great gamified set of courses for learning all things about programming (from level 0 to your first job !) - From Lane Wagner & great software engineers !
- [ComputerEnhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com/) - A very well presented and crafted series of video modules, on performance aware programming. It's a must. - From Casey Muratori.
- [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) - A website for getting started with project based learning in the programming language of your choice ! (_mostly_). Free projects rotations !
